# Project_N
This project is to get nutrients from a food image without any other information

Step One:
Fine tuned a Image to text VIT model on Food Image data

Step Two:
Will be Building a neural network to predict the preparation process from name and ingridients predicted

Step Three:
Will be Building a neural network to come up the nutrients from the preparation process

Step Four:
Testing Everything and Improving the models
